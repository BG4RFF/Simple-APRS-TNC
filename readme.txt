Simple inexpensive APRS TNC/beacon based on wb8wga's one

Original work I adapted: http://www.enide.net/webcms/index.php?page=wb8wga-tnc

This device works as a stand alone configurable APRS beacon/digipeater and also as a serial to APRS terminal. Go to wb8wga's website to find more about it.

I scaled everything into SMD to make it as small as possible, removed the MAX232, as I intend to use this on embedded TTL devices and also I removed the connectors and left it as pin rows, also to embed it / save space.

3x05Ball.zip is the original TNC firmware, on which the wb8wga one is based, it should be compatible and make this board work as a standard APRS TNC.
I upload it here as is a bit hard to find, but I claim no ownership over it.
